I deem it my privilege to serve as the Head of the department (School of Architecture) at GNDEC.
In the on-going journey since 8th April, 1956, Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College has become an institution of iconic marvel in academics, sports and sciences. So, our department’s commitment to follow the path of success and our forte to strive for better shall definitely lead us towards greater heights.
We are leading a team of intellectuals / faculty who are skillful and resourceful in various domains to take up challenges and deliver creative qualitative knowledge base.
At School of Architecture, GNDEC, our focus is on the students. The responsibility as faculty is to adopt an approach that builds up confidence, make them creative, innovative, and strengthen their entrepreneurial skills. Our understanding is that persons who are clear and thorough about the fundamentals of architectural detailing can adapt to rapid changes in technology relatively easily. We want the education imparted to our students to be the basis of a life time of learning.
